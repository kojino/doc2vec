I thought my automatic payments would end in XX/XX/XXXX. I called Honda Financial in XX/XX/XXXX to find out when my car will be paid off. Honda told me my car was paid off XX/XX/XXXX and I should have gotten my title. I never received my title and found out my automatic payments of {$130.00} were still being automatically deducted thru my XXXX checking account thru XX/XX/XXXX. I called Honda Financial and they had my old address on file, stated my title was originally sent there and it was eventually forwarded back to Honda. They told me I had to contact XXXX to have my automatic payments stopped and have XXXX reimburse all of the payments made to Honda after XX/XX/XXXX. They also told me I had to get a release of lien from the DMV to apply for a new title. I had to make multiple phone calls to XXXX and Honda to try to get this resolved. Whenever I called Honda I would get a different rep on the line and would have to explain the situation every time, sometimes getting different information from each rep. One rep was able to find out that they had my car title on file at Honda and they could mail it to me at my current address, which was different from what another rep told me before. XXXX told me they would only be able to go back 60 days of payments made in error and would reimburse me for the payments within those 60 days. I have to ask Honda to reimburse me for the remaining payments. I called Honda again after I talked with XXXX. XXXX said that so far they have record of XXXX checks that were mailed to my old address. They owe me 3 payments of {$130.00} after the money XXXX reimbursed me. They said that for each payment they have to research to see if the check was cashed first. If the check was n't cashed then they could send me a new check to my current address. The total that is owed to me is {$1000.00}. XXXX was able to reimburse me {$680.00}. Honda still owes me {$410.00}. I did finally receive the title in the mail. I 'm afraid they still do n't have my correct address on file because every time I call Honda they ask for security what my current address is and they tell me that they only have my old address on file. Each phone call I gave them my current home address, but it was never changed in their computer system. I asked last week to talk with a manager and they said one will call me back. I so far have n't received a call from a manager. I would like to be reimbursed the amount owed to me with interest.

I have tried to have this corrected, but have received no response.
